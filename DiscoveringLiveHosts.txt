-ARP from Link Layer
-ICMP from Network Layer
-TCP from Transport Layer
-UDP from Transport Layer

Arp has one purpose sending a frame to the broadcast address on the network segment and asking the computer with a specific IP address to respond by providing its MAC hardware address.
ICMP has many types. ICMP ping uses type 8 (ECHO) and type 0 (ECHO REPLY)

If you want to ping a system on the same subnet an ARP query should precede the ICMP ECHO

Although TCP and UDP are transport layers, for networking scanning purposes a scanner can send a specially crafted packet to common TCP or UDP ports to check whether the target will respond. This method is efficient, especially when ICMP ECHO is blocked. ICMP ECHO is also known as a ping.
