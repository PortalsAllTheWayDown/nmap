Ping = ICMP type8/ECHO requests with a ping reply ICMP Type 0

Many firewalls block ICMP echo; new versions of MS Windows are configured with a host firewall that blocks ICMP echo requests by default.

ARP query will come before the ICMP request if your target is on the same subnet.

To use ICMP echo request to discover live hosts, add te option -PE and remember to add -sn if you dont want to follow that with a port scan.

example use: sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24

It will return the hosts on the subnet that your on and also their MAC addresses if the ARP request receive responses.

If you run the sudo nmap -PE -sn 10.10.68.220/24 as this is on a different subnet it will send out the ICMP pings.

In wireshark if you filter for icmp you should see the pings.

Because ICMP echo requests tend to be blocked you might also conside ICMP timestamp or icmp address mask requests to tell if a system is online. Nmap uses timestamp request (ICMP Type 13) and checks whether it will get a timestamp reply(ICMP type 14). Adding the -PP option tells Nmap to use ICMP timestamp requests.

nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24
Again if on wireshark you dont see the icmp traffic its because your ARP on your subnet came back with replies probably.

Its good to know multiple different types of ICMP because a firewall could block both of the previous types.

so lets run ICMP address mask queries, we run the command nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24
