TCP SYN Ping
-PS is the option used

We can send a packet with SYN (Synchronize) flag set to a TCP port, 80 by default and wait for a response.
An open port should reply with a SYN/ACK (Acknowledge); a closed port would result in an RST (Reset).

To use nmap to use tcp syn ping use option -PS followed by the port number, range, list, or combination of them.

For example -PS21 will target port 21. While -PS21-25 will scan ports 21-25
-PS80,443,8080 will scan those three ports.


privileged users can send TCP SYN packets and dont need to complte the TCP 3 way handshake even if the port is open.
unprivileged users have no choice but to complete the 3 way handshake if the port is open.

nmap -PS -sn MACHINE_IP/24 to scan the subnet.
When running on your same subnet your machine is on it will just run arp requests again asking for those ips.
When running against another subnet it will send the tcp syns out

TCP ACK Ping
-PA is the option used

Must be in privileged user mode to be able to use this, in unprivileged nmap will attempt a 3 way handshake

By default port 80 is used. The syntax is similar to TCP SYN ping -PA should be followed by a port number, range, list or a combination of them.

example: sudo nmap -PA -sn 10.10.68.220/24

The responding computer will respond with a RST flag because the TCP packet with the ACK isnot part of any ongoing connection.

UDP Ping
-PU is the option used

Contrary to TCP SYN ping, sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to lead to any reply. However if we send a UDP packet to a closed UDP port, we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet; this indicates that the target system is up and available.

The ICMP is Type 3, Code 3 this indicates "Destination Port Unreachable"

sudo nmap -PU -sn 10.10.68.220/24

In the same sense that an IP address specifies a host on a network among many others, a TCP port or UDP port is used to identify a network servce running on that host.
A server provides the network service and it adheres to a specific network protool. Examples include providing time, responding to DNS queries, and serving web pages.
A port is usually linked to a service using that specific port number.
For instance an HTTP server would bind to TCP port 80 by default; moreover if the HTTP server supports SSL/TLS it would listen on TCP port 443. (TCP ports 80 and 443 are the default ports for HTTP and HTTPS; however, the webserver administrator might choose other port numbers if necessary.)
No more than one service can listen on any TCP or UDP port (on the same IP address)

Simplification:
    -Open port indicates that there is some service listening on that port.
    -Closed port indicates that there is no service listening on that port.

However there could be a firewall messing up your scanning showing its closed but its open, the firewall blocking the packets.
Therefore Nmap considers the following six states:
    -Open: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.
    -Closed: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. By accessible we mean that it is reachable and is blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.
    -Filtered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible. This state is usally due to a firewall preventing Nmap from raeching that port. Nmaps packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap's host.
    -Unfiltered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, although the port is accessible. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan -sA
    -Open|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.
    -Closed|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.

TCP FLAGS

Nmap supports different types of TCP port scans. To understand the difference between these port scans, we need to review the TCP header. The TCP header is the first 24 bytes of a TCP segment.
In the header we have the TCP port number and destination port number.
in the next rows we have the sequence number and the acknowledgement number. Each row has 32 bits(4bytes) allocated, with six rows total making up 24 bytes.

TCP Flags that we can use:
-URG: Urgent flag indicates that the urgent pointer filed is significant The urgent pointer indicates taht the incoming data is urgent, and thats a TCP segment with the URG flag set is processed immediately without consideration of having to wait on previously sent TCP segments.
-ACK: Acknowledgement flag indicates that the acknowledgement number is significant. it is used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment.
-PSH: Push flag asking TCP to pass the data to the application  promptly.
-SYN: Synchronize flag is used to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake and synchronize sequence numbers with the other host. The sequence number should be set randomly during TCP connection establishment.
-FIN: The send has no more data to send.

TCP connect scan works by completing the TCP 3-way handshake. In standard TCP connection establishment, the client sends a TCP packet with SYN flag set, and the server responds with SYN/ACK if the port is open; finally, the client completes the 3-way handshake by sending an ACK.
SYN  SYN,ACK  ACK

Its about finding out if the TCP port is open, not establishing a TCP connection hence the connection is torn as soon as its state is confirmed by sending a RST/ACK. You can choose to run TCP connect scan using -sT

If you are not a privileged user, a TCP connect scan is the only possible option to discover open TCP ports.

nmap -sT 10.10.187.59

its better to run a SYN scan as it doesnt need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake.
It tears down the connection once it receives a response from the server. Because we didnt establish a TCP connection, this decreases the cahnges of the scan being logged.
We can select this scan by using -sS option.

UDP is a connectionless protocol, and hence it does not require any handshake for connection establishment.
