TCP SYN Ping
-PS is the option used

We can send a packet with SYN (Synchronize) flag set to a TCP port, 80 by default and wait for a response.
An open port should reply with a SYN/ACK (Acknowledge); a closed port would result in an RST (Reset).

To use nmap to use tcp syn ping use option -PS followed by the port number, range, list, or combination of them.

For example -PS21 will target port 21. While -PS21-25 will scan ports 21-25
-PS80,443,8080 will scan those three ports.


privileged users can send TCP SYN packets and dont need to complte the TCP 3 way handshake even if the port is open.
unprivileged users have no choice but to complete the 3 way handshake if the port is open.

nmap -PS -sn MACHINE_IP/24 to scan the subnet.
When running on your same subnet your machine is on it will just run arp requests again asking for those ips.
When running against another subnet it will send the tcp syns out

TCP ACK Ping
-PA is the option used

Must be in privileged user mode to be able to use this, in unprivileged nmap will attempt a 3 way handshake

By default port 80 is used. The syntax is similar to TCP SYN ping -PA should be followed by a port number, range, list or a combination of them.

example: sudo nmap -PA -sn 10.10.68.220/24

The responding computer will respond with a RST flag because the TCP packet with the ACK isnot part of any ongoing connection.

UDP Ping
-PU is the option used

Contrary to TCP SYN ping, sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to lead to any reply. However if we send a UDP packet to a closed UDP port, we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet; this indicates that the target system is up and available.

The ICMP is Type 3, Code 3 this indicates "Destination Port Unreachable"

sudo nmap -PU -sn 10.10.68.220/24

In the same sense that an IP address specifies a host on a network among many others, a TCP port or UDP port is used to identify a network servce running on that host.
A server provides the network service and it adheres to a specific network protool. Examples include providing time, responding to DNS queries, and serving web pages.
A port is usually linked to a service using that specific port number.
