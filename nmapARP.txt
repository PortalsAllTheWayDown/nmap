When a privileged user tries to scan targest on a local network, Nmap uses ARP requests. A privileged user is root or  someone on sudoers.

When a privileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmaap uses ICMP echo requests, TCP ACK to port 80, TCP SYN to port 443, and ICMP timestamp request.

When an unprivileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network Nmap resorts to a TCP 3-way handshake by sending SYN packets to ports 80 and 443.

Nmap by default uses a ping scan to find live hosts then proceeds to scan live hosts only. You can use nmap to discover online hosts without port scanning the live systems, you can issue nmap -sn TARGETS.

So you only use the ARP scan if you are on the same subnet as the target systems. On an Ethernet(802.3) and Wifi (802.11), you need to know the MAC address of any system before you can communicate with it. The MAC address is necessary for the link layer header; the header conatins the source MAC address and the destination MAC address among other fields.

To run Nmap with just ARP without port scanning you can use: nmap -PR -sn TARGETS
where -PR indicates that you only want an ARP scan.

to discover all hosts on your subnet: nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24
This will run it on the range.

There is a scanner built aroudn ARP queries: arp-scan it provides many options to customize your scan.
apt install arp-scan
